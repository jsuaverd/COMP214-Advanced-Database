This repository contains the assignments and final project neccessary to complete COMP214- Advance Database course of Centennial College.

For the final project, our group decided to create a database to manage a Health care system of new clinic in Toronto.
We are required to demonstrate our learnings in database creation( especially PL/SQL) and software development.

We used Oracle Sql Developer to store our data and we used Flask to create a web application.
For the application to run, we need to download cx_Oracle python extension and add that extension in system environment variable

Here is the screencap of our application:
